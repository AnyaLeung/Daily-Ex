Tables are often not designed to be readable to humans--  

they're designed to be the best way to store data with the 

highest amount of maintainability and which is the least bug prone. 


In many cases, it may be best to split information into multiple related tables, 

so that there is less redundant data and less places to update.


*
```
IINSERT INTO table_name COLUMN (column1, column2...);
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (values1, values2...);
```

*
join: cross join, implicit inner join, explicit inner join (to be summarizd)

* 
outer join
    LEFT OUTER JOIN
    FULL OUTER JOIN
